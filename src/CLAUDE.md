# Code conventions for this project's `src/`

This file applies when Claude is working in `remittance-stub-parsing/src/`.

## Style

- Match the existing code style. If there's a linter config, follow it strictly.
- New files mirror the structure of nearby existing files.
- No mixing of paradigms inside a module without a reason worth stating in DECISIONS.md.

## Naming

- Functions: verbs (`parse_config`, `fetch_user`)
- Variables: nouns (`user_config`, `parsed_result`)
- Booleans: predicates (`is_ready`, `has_items`)
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're standard in this codebase.

## Imports

- Sort imports: external first, then internal absolute, then relative.
- No unused imports left in code.

## Comments

- Comment why, not what. The code already says what.
- TODO comments include a date or issue reference.

## Tests

- Each new non-trivial function gets at least one test in `tests/`.
- Test names describe behavior in plain English: `test_returns_null_when_input_is_empty`.
- Avoid testing implementation details — test inputs and outputs.

## Error handling

- Don't swallow errors. If you catch one, log or rethrow with context.
- No bare `except:` blocks without comment explaining why.

## Don't invent

- Before adding a new utility, check if a similar one already exists.
- Before adding a dependency, ask the user (and log to DECISIONS.md).
- Before refactoring an existing pattern, surface it as a question, not a fait accompli.

## When stuck

- Smallest reproducer.
- One change at a time.
- Run the test, read the actual output (not what you expected).
